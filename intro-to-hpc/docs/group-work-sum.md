# Calculating sum in parallel

<small>

- Task: calculate sum of 20 numbers
- Assumptions: 
    - Summing up two numbers takes **1 s** and communicating single number takes **0.1 s** 
    - No time is needed for setting up the problem and distributing work
- Work out with pen and paper how much time is needed when the work is performed with 1, 2, 4, and 
  8 workers. What is the speed-up with different number of workers?
- Discuss what limits parallel scaling and how parallel efficiency could be improved.
- Does the situation change if the task is to calculate 1020 numbers? What is now 
  the parallel speed-up with eight workers?
