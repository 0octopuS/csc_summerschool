Take a look at the exercise skeleton in
[data-sharing/](.). Add an OpenMP parallel region aroung
the block where the variables `Var1` and `Var2` are printed and
manipulated. What results do you get when you define the variables as
**shared**, **private** or **firstprivate**? Explain why do you get
different results.
