# Broadcast and scatter

Write a program using send and receive calls to implement **broadcast** and **scatter**
operations. We will see later in the course how to do this using MPIâ€™s collective operations,
but it is useful to implement them by hand as they illustrate how to communicate all or part
of an array of data using point-to-point operations.

1. Create an integer array of size N (e.g. N=12) and initialize it as follows:
   - rank 0: i (i=1,12)
   - other ranks: -1
2. Print out the initial values in all the processes
3. Implement **broadcast**: rank 0 sends the contents of the entire array to other ranks.
   Print out the final values in all the processes.
4. Implement **scatter**: imagine that the array is divided into blocks of size N / P (P=number of
   processes), and rank 0 sends a different block to other ranks, so that the rank *i* receives
   the *i*th block. Print out the final values in all the processes.


You may start from scratch or use [skeleton.cpp](c/skeleton.cpp) (or
[skeleton.F90](fortran/skeleton.F90) for Fortran) as a starting point.
