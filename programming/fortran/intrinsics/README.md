## Array intrinsic functions

Start from the dynamically allocatable array presented in exercise [Dynamic arrays](../arrays)
or from the skeleton code provided at
[intrinsics.F90](intrinsics.F90). Use suitable array intrinsic
functions to print out the following details:

 - What is the sum of elements across the 2nd dimension of A?

 - Find the location coordinates of the maximum elements of A.

 - What is the absolute minimum value of the array A?

 - Are all elements of A greater than or equal to zero?

 - How many elements of A are greater than or equal to 0.5?
