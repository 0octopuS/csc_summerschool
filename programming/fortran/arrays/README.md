## Dynamic arrays

- Define a two-dimensional real-valued array, which should be
dynamically allocatable.
- Allocate the array with sizes (nx, ny) read in from the user input
- Initialize it to the values of the function f(x,y)=x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>  in the square x = [0,1], y =[0,1] (i.e. divide the intervals into nx/ny points).

A skeleton code provided in [arrays.F90](arrays.F90).
