## Control structures

a) Define a two-dimensional (nx-by-ny), real-valued array and initialize it 
to the values of the function f(x,y)=x^2+y^2  in the square x = [0,1], 
y =[0,1] using nx = ny = 10. Exercise skeleton is available in 
[do-loop.F90](do-loop.F90).

b) Write a control structure which checks whether an integer is negative, 
zero, or larger than 100 and performs corresponding write. Investigate 
the behavior with different integer values.

c) Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers defined by the recurrence 
relation 
 Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with the initial values F0=0, F1=1. Print out Fibonacci numbers Fn < 100 i
using a `do while` loop.
