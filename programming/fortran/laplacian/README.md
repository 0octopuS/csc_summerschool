## Laplacian

Write a double do loop for evaluating the Laplacian using the
finite-difference approximation

Start from the skeleton [laplacian.F90](laplacian.F90). Test your
implementation with the function implemented in Exercise 2a. The
analytic solution for that function is $\nabla^2 f(x,y) = 4$, check
the correctness of your implementation.
