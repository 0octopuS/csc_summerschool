## Subroutines and modules

Write three subroutines for

 - array initialization
 - computing a Laplacian
 - printing out a given array
 
and put them in a separate module.

Then, write a main program that

 - defines two (dynamically allocatable) arrays, `previous` and `current`
 - initialize the `previous` array
 - apply the Laplacian on the initialized array
 - print out both arrays (after and before the Laplacian) 
 
 by calling the three module procedures described above. You can use the provided skeleton codes
[laplacian.F90](laplacian.F90) and [main.F90](main.F90).
